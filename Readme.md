## DevConnect
WDA project executed using the MERN stack and springboot.

### Why are there two frontends and backends?
1. The first backend is of node running on port 3000 whereas the other backend is of springboot running on port 8080 made in springboot.
```The springboot backend("backend-spring") is used in the final product.```

2. The first frontend is the one made without using a framework (from 1st sem), the second one is a stepped up version of the previous one made in react@vite. 
```The react one("devconnect-frontend") is used in the final project.```
